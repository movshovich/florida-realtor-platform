# 🤖 Automated Deployment - Render API

## Current Status

I can help you deploy, but Render requires authentication. Here's how we can proceed:

## Option 1: Render API (Programmatic)

If you provide your Render API key, I can deploy programmatically:

1. **Get Render API Key**:
   - Go to: https://dashboard.render.com/account/api-keys
   - Create a new API key
   - Share it with me (or set as environment variable)

2. **I'll use it to**:
   - Create the web service
   - Set environment variables
   - Deploy the backend
   - Run migrations

## Option 2: Render CLI (Interactive)

I can guide you through Render CLI setup:

```bash
# Install Render CLI
npm i -g @render/cli

# Login
render login

# Deploy
cd backend
render deploy
```

## Option 3: Manual Setup (I'll guide you)

I can walk you through the Render dashboard step-by-step in real-time.

## What I Need From You

To proceed with automated deployment, I need:

1. **Render API Key** (for programmatic access)
   OR
2. **Permission to guide you through Render dashboard** (for manual setup)

## Current Setup

✅ Frontend: https://frontend-78y7317t7-movshovichs-projects.vercel.app
✅ Code: https://github.com/movshovich/florida-realtor-platform
✅ Backend configs ready
✅ Environment variables documented

## Next Steps

1. Choose an option above
2. Provide API key OR allow me to guide you
3. I'll complete the deployment

Which option would you prefer?
